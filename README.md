# Smart Chemiluminescence
In this IoT based project, chemicals like Luminol, Hydrogen Peroxide etc. are made to react with each other, resulting in the production of luminiscence. 
Luminol and other chemicals are stored in a transparent container which acts as the bulb while Hydrogen Peroxide is stored in another container which also 
contains a pump which transfers the contents to the transparent container based on the intensity of light produced.

## Chemicals Required
1. Luminol
2. Hydrogen Peroxide (diluted)

## Components Required
1. Arduino UNO
2. Relay Module (12V or 5V)
3. Battery (12V or 5V)
4. LDR
5. Water Pump (12V or 5V)
